# Project

The U-Prove JavaScript SDK implements the client-side of the [U-Prove Cryptographic Specification](http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=166969), and is a companion to the [U-Prove C# SDK](https://uprovecsharp.codeplex.com/). It can be used to write web clients interacting with U-Prove services. The SDK makes use of the [MSR JavaScript Cryptography Library](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/29f9385d-da4c-479a-b2ea-2a7bb335d727/).
